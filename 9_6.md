# Spatial Population Description

The country that I chose to model was Côte D'Ivoire.

This is the image of the entire country:

One challenge that I had with this image and the other images 
was figuring out how to move the text so that the names of the 
counties and districts won't overlap. I tried my best 
to prevent overlap, but ask you can see in the image, 
it isn't 100%. 

I chose to model the second most populous county in the Ivory
Coast, because the most populous county did not have any
districts.

But in the final image, I chose to include the most populous
county, Abidjan, as one of the smaller plots. I also included
the group of Montagnes, Sassandra-Marahoué, and Bas-Sassandra 
counties. The overlap issue was also present in this plot.
